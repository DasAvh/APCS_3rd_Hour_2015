Instructions: 
Have each player choose a character before starting the game. 
Your goal is to investigate a grisly murder (Chavez) 
and find the murderer, the weapon he/she used, 
and the room he/she did it in. Players will roll the dice 
on his/her turn. Once the dice is rolled, move your  character 
the number of dots on the dice. You may enter a room 
if it is within the number of moves on your turn.  At the end of each turn, 
a menu will open up. Choose an option.
