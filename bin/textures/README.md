Textures
========
Each folder holds sprite sheets that used hold the games images. A Sprite sheet is basically a collection of images loaded into one image. This one image is then cropped in the program and stored into BufferedImages. This is done to avoid loading tons of files. A sprite sheet can hold as many images as you want. The template is a 4 X 4 grid with each grid piece holding a 32 x 32 image.
